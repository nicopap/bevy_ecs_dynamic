# bevy_mod_dynamic_query

Fork of <https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy_ecs_dynamic>, a prototype
for dynamic queries in bevy.

`bevy_ecs_dynamic` was severly out of date and was missing a few query parameters:

- `Or<(â€¦)>`
- `Option<Component>`
- Some other kind of queries that are a combinations of the previous

In logic, we can always express a logical expression as a [disjunction of
conjunctions][dnf]. So we can use a `Vec<Vec<Filter>>` to express `Or`s.

[dnf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form

We can always provide an API that accepts a arbitrary logic expression and
flatten it if necessary.

### External API draft

Suppose we have a script that wants to query anything.

```javascript
function damage_system(q) {
  for (item in q) {
    let [health, damage, opt_armor] = item;
    var real_damage = damage;
    if (opt_armor != null) {
      if (opt_armor > damage) {
        real_damage -= opt_armor;
      } else {
        real_damage = 1;
      }
    }
    health.set(health.get() - real_damage);
  }
}
// equivalent to:
// Query<
//     (&mut Health, &Damage, Option<&Armor>),
//     Or<(
//         (With<Player>, Without<Invicible>),
//         (With<Enemy>, Without<FirstBossYouAreMeantToDieFrom>),
//     )>
// >,
var my_query = {
  fetch: [
    mut("Health"),
    read("Damage"),
    read_nullable("Armor"),
  ],
  filter: or(
    and("Player", not("Invicible")),
    and("Enemy", not("FirstBossYouAreMeantToDieFrom")),
  ),
};
runtime.register_system(my_query, damage_system);
```


## Future works

### Avoid `DynamicItem` heap allocation

Currently this requires keeping an interal "scratch buffer" allocated on the
heap to accumulate items and serve them.
In the general case, it's impossible to get rid of this, since you need to
know at compile time the size of stack-allocated variables.
- This induces one major limitation: Can't concurrently have several items
  live without heap allocation. You should be able to keep around a previous
  set of item by using `Clone`, but this requires heap allocation
- `SmallVec` seems like an easy win, since not many components are fetched usually
- `ArrayVec` also works and avoids bimodal performance, But it requires a compile-time
  max query fetch size.
- For a compile-time use-case such as relation, it should be possible to
  use `typenum` to get fixed-size array rather than a stack-allocate slice

### Flexibility wrapper

`DynamicQuery` is more limited than bevy's `Query`. It notably can't handle
duplicate fetch/filter items and nested `Or`.

We can do as much transformation on the filter part before creating the
`DynamicQuery` as we want, since it will always be opaque to the end-user.

This means we can:

- Resolve the `Filter` logical statement through a SAT solver. We can even
  eliminate redundant clauses, fuse the `Fetches` in as well.
- Eliminate redundant components (including with `Fetches`). Some operations
  are time-proportional to the number of components, and validity depends on
  abscence of redundant elements, so we should get rid of them automatically.

When it comes to the `Fetches` part of the query. It becomes a bit more tricky.
We need to:

- Verify the items of the query respect exclusive mutability rules
- Remap the `DynamicItem` slice when accessing it
- Re-nest the items potentially if we want to let users have `[[foo, bar], [baz]]`
  This may be useful to support query aliases or dictionaries.

We can also introduce additional combinators like `AnyOf` in the wrapper.

### Late component ID binding

Currently we extract from `TypeRegistry` the `ReflectFromPtr`s as soon as we
construct `DynamicQuery`. This means we need to update `ReflectFromPtr` when
it changes, and we can't refer to components that will be added after the
`DynamicQuery` is created.
